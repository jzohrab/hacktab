# Tabber

# Development

## Overview

This project uses:

- Parcel for bundling the Javascript
- Tape for unit tests
- Aubiojs for js audio processing

## Requirements

node - v14.16.0
npm - 6.14.11

I haven't tried other versions, but the above worked for me on my Mac.

## Getting started

```
git clone <this repo>
cd <repo path>
npm install

# Build and start the local Parcel server
npm start

# Then go to the local address it tells you
```

## Running tests

`npm run test`

## Contributing

Contributions would be super if it makes this more useful and interesting.

Fork; clone; make you changes and be sure to run `npm run test`; PR back to main.

# Licensing

TODO - should be free and open.  Have to set the licensing correctly to account for the open-source elements that are included (aubio)
